solver that navigate all the problem's truth table, it works fine but it's exponential.
 - 	the next step would be verify if the coverage of the clause from (a^b^c) TO (f'^g'^h') fulfil the problem's
	truth table for the variables (other... a b c ...other... f g h ....other) in which it is composed the expression
	with all the clauses attached from (a^b^c) TO (f'^g'^h')

solver to simply the expression in a multithread way; it doesn't work properly, to fix it!
